# ScribIQ — Multi-Agent Software Development Environment

ScribIQ is a multi-agent, AI-powered software development environment designed to transform ideas into scalable, modular, production-grade applications autonomously.

Unlike traditional AI builders, ScribIQ introduces persistent reasoning across large projects through a proprietary pruning engine that enables effectively infinite context in practical workflows.

## 🧠 What ScribIQ Does
ScribIQ enables developers and builders to:

- Generate full-stack applications using multi-agent collaboration
- Maintain persistent context across long and complex projects
- Automatically produce modular and maintainable architectures
- Execute multi-step development workflows autonomously
- Deploy production-ready software with minimal manual intervention

## ⚙️ Architecture Philosophy
ScribIQ is built around an agent orchestration approach where specialized AI agents collaborate across the full software lifecycle — from ideation to deployment.

At the core is a proprietary pruning engine that acts as a context orchestration layer, enabling reliable long-running agent execution with reduced token consumption.
